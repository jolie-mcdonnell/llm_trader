# **llm_trader**

**llm_trader** is an automated stock trading program that leverages the power of large language models (LLMs), like GPT, to make real-time investment decisions based on recent news. The program scrapes stock-related news headlines from **Google News** and **Finnhub**, processes them using GPT to generate short-term investment strategies (Buy, Sell, Do Nothing), and then executes the trades through the **Alpaca API**.

The trading strategy is based on [Can ChatGPT Forecast Stock Price Movements? Return Predictability and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07619) by Alejandro Lopez-Lira and Yuehua Tang. 


### **Features**
- Scrapes recent stock-related news headlines from **Google News** and **Finnhub**.
- Uses **OpenAI GPT** to analyze the news and generate an investment strategy (Buy, Sell, or Do Nothing).
- Executes stock trades twice a day: once at market open and once at market close.
- Trades are executed through the **Alpaca API**.
- Automated workflows using **GitHub Actions** to manage scraping, decision-making, and trading.

### **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: The core programming language for scraping, LLM integration, and trade execution.
- **BeautifulSoup**: Used for scraping stock-related headlines from **Google News**.

2. **Create a Finnhub Account**
   - Visit the [Finnhub website](https://finnhub.io/) and sign up for an account.
   - After signing up, go to your **dashboard** and obtain your **API key**. This key is necessary for accessing the stock-related news API.

3. **Create an OpenAI Account**
   - Visit the [OpenAI website](https://beta.openai.com/signup/) and create an account.
   - After signing up, go to the **API section** to generate your **OpenAI API key**. This key will be used to interact with GPT models for analyzing news and generating investment strategies.

  This repository is set up to run the automated tasks using GitHub Actions. Ensure your repositoryâ€™s secrets are set correctly, and the workflow will run twice per day to trigger scraping, decision-making, and trade execution.

### **How it Works**

1. **Scraping News**  
   The program scrapes stock-related headlines from two sources:
   - **Google News**: Uses **BeautifulSoup** and the **Google News API** to gather relevant news headlines.
   - **Finnhub**: Uses the **Finnhub API** to collect additional stock-related news.

2. **Processing News with GPT**  
   The scraped headlines are processed by **OpenAI GPT-3/4** to generate an investment strategy. GPT analyzes the sentiment, relevance, and potential impact of the headlines to create one of the following strategies:
   - **Buy**: The model recommends purchasing the stock.
   - **Sell**: The model suggests selling the stock.
   - **Do Nothing**: The model advises holding the stock.

3. **Executing Trades**  
   Once the strategy is determined, the program executes the trade using the **Alpaca API**. Trades are made based on the strategy generated by GPT. The execution happens twice daily:
   - **At Market Open**: Typically around **9:30 AM EST**.
   - **At Market Close**: Typically around **4:00 PM EST**.

4. **Automation with GitHub Actions**  
   The entire process is automated using **GitHub Actions**, which triggers the tasks twice a day:
   - **Scraping**: The system scrapes the latest stock-related news.
   - **Processing**: GPT generates a trading strategy.
   - **Execution**: Trades are executed based on the generated strategy.

   This automation ensures that the system stays up-to-date with the latest market data and continuously executes trades according to the evolving market conditions.
