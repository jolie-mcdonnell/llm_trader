# **llm_trader**

**llm_trader** is an automated stock trading program that leverages the power of large language models (LLMs), like GPT, to make real-time investment decisions based on recent news. The program scrapes stock-related news headlines from **Google News** and **Finnhub**, processes them using GPT to generate short-term investment strategies (Buy, Sell, Do Nothing), and then executes the trades through the **Alpaca API**.

The trading strategy is based on [Can ChatGPT Forecast Stock Price Movements? Return Predictability and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07619) by Alejandro Lopez-Lira and Yuehua Tang. 


### **Features**
- Scrapes recent stock-related news headlines from **Google News** and **Finnhub**.
- Uses **OpenAI GPT** to analyze the news and generate an investment strategy (Buy, Sell, or Do Nothing).
- Executes stock trades via **Alpaca** twice a day: once at market open and once at market close.
- Automates the article scraping, LLM-based decision-making, and trading workflows using **GitHub Actions**.

### **Creating Accounts and Generating API Keys**

To use **llm_trader**, you'll need to create accounts with **Alpaca**, **Finnhub**, and **OpenAI** to generate the required API keys. Follow the steps below to set up each account and obtain your API keys:

   - Visit the [Alpaca website](https://alpaca.markets/) and sign up for a **paper trading account**.
   - Once registered, navigate to the **API section** of your Alpaca dashboard to generate your **API key** and **secret key**.

2. **Create a Finnhub Account**
   - Visit the [Finnhub website](https://finnhub.io/) and sign up for an account.
   - After signing up, go to the paper trading dashboard and obtain your **API key**.

3. **Create an OpenAI Account**

   - After signing up, go to the **API section** to generate your **OpenAI API key**. 
### **Installation**

To get started with **llm_trader**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jolie-mcdonnell/llm_trader.git
   cd llm_trader
   ```
2. **Create a Virtual Environemnt and Install Required Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Set up environment variables:**
   You will need to create a paper trading account with Alpaca and obtain your API keys. Set the following environment variables in GitHub Secrets or in a .env file:
   - ALPACA_API_KEY: Your Alpaca API key for paper trading.
   - ALPACA_SECRET_KEY: Your Alpaca secret API key.
   - OPENAI_API_KEY: Your OpenAI GPT API key.
   - FINNHUB_API_KEY: Your Finnhub API key.
4. **Configure GitHub Actions Workflow:**
  This repository is set up to run the automated tasks using GitHub Actions. Ensure your repositoryâ€™s secrets are set correctly, and the workflow will run twice per day to trigger scraping, decision-making, and trade execution.

### **How it Works**

1. **Scraping News**  
   The program scrapes stock-related headlines from two sources:
   - **Google News**: Uses **BeautifulSoup** and the **Google News API** to gather relevant news headlines.
   - **Finnhub**: Uses the **Finnhub API** to collect more precise stock-related news.

2. **Processing News with GPT**  
   The scraped headlines are processed by **OpenAI GPT-3/4** to generate an investment strategy. GPT analyzes the sentiment, relevance, and potential impact of the headlines to create one of the following strategies: **Buy**, **Sell**, **Do Nothing**.

3. **Executing Trades**  
   Once the strategy is determined, the program executes the trade using the **Alpaca API**. Trades are made based on the strategy generated by GPT. The execution happens twice daily:
   - **At Market Open**: Typically around **9:30 AM EST**.
   - **At Market Close**: Typically around **4:00 PM EST**.
   - The trades are rebalanced every day at market close.

4. **Automation with GitHub Actions**  
   The entire process is automated using **GitHub Actions**, which triggers the tasks throughout the day.

   This automation ensures that the system stays up-to-date with the latest market data and continuously executes trades according to the evolving market conditions.


### **Results**
In practice, the algorithm did not perform nearly as well as reported in the article, but it was a fun project in algorithmic trading!
